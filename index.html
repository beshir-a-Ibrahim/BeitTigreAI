# BeitTigreAI: NLP Resources for the Tigre Language

> **Beit** (á‰¤á‰µ) means "home" or "hub" in Tigre.  
> This is a home for AI and NLP development for the **Tigre language** â€” the closest living relative of Classical Geez.

## ðŸ“š Overview

The **Tigre language**, spoken in Eritrea and eastern Sudan, is the closest living relative to **Classical Geez** â€” a foundational Semitic language of immense historical and religious significance. While Geez is no longer spoken, **Tigre remains a vibrant, living language**, with growing digital presence on platforms such as:

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigre_language)
- [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/languages/tig) â€“ community voice recordings
- [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/sentences?from=tig) â€“ sentence database
- Radio, TV, newspapers, and religious texts

Despite this vitality, **Tigre has been largely overlooked in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This project aims to close that gap by providing open-access **data, models, and tools** for researchers, developers, and the Tigre-speaking community.

Moreover, due to its linguistic closeness to Geez, advances in **Tigre NLP** can serve as a **bridge to understanding and potentially revitalizing Classical Geez**.

## ðŸ§© Data

We have compiled a diverse corpus from multiple sources:

| Type | Description | Sources |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **1. Speech** | Audio recordings in Tigre | Common Voice, field recordings, radio archives |
| **2. Speech/Text** | Aligned audio-transcript pairs | Common Voice, broadcast subtitles |
| **3. Text** | Monolingual written Tigre | Books, news, Wikipedia, social media, religious texts |
| **4. Parallel Data (Translation)** | Bilingual sentence pairs (e.g., Tigreâ€“English) | Tatoeba, translated documents, crowdsourced efforts |

> All data is curated and available in standard formats (`.txt`, `.csv`, `.jsonl`, `.wav`).

## ðŸ¤– Trained Models

We leverage state-of-the-art frameworks to develop models for Tigre:

| Model | Description | Framework / Base Model |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| **1. Machine Translation** | Translate between Tigre and other languages | Meta's [NLLB](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/no-language-left-behind/) / [Sonar](https://ai.meta.com/sonar/) |
| **2. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** | Speech-to-text for Tigre | Meta's [Wav2Vec2-BERT](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/wav2vec-2-0-a-framework-for-self-supervised-learning-of-speech-representations/) |
| **3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)** | Synthesize natural-sounding Tigre speech | [rhasspy/piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) |
| **4. Large Language Model (LLM)** | Generative AI for Tigre text | **Llama 3.2-based**, fine-tuned (in progress) |

> The LLM is currently under development. Early checkpoints will be shared soon.

> Models are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/beshir-a-Ibrahim).
